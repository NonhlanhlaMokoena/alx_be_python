#User Input Age Calculator. This Python script asks the user for their current age and then calculates how old they will be in a specific future year.

current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

#Calculate how old the user will be in the year 2050. We assume the current year is 2023. Therefore, we add 27 years to the user’s current age.
future_age = current_age + 27

print("In 2050, you will be", future_age, "years old.")
