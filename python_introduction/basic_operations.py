# Basic Arithmetic Exercise. Step 1: Declare a variable number and assign a value
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Step 2: Arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction and multiplication
addition = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

# Step 3: Printing the results of these operations in a human-readable format
print("Addition", "of", number1, "and", number2, "is", addition)
print("Subraction", "of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference)
print("Multiplication", "of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product)
